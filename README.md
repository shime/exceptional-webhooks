# Exceptional Webhooks


> You can supply us with a URL that we will POST to every time a new exception occurs (or a closed exception re-occurs).
> We will send a JSON object containing information about the exception to your URL.
> You can use this to build your own service that performs some action every time an exception is thrown.

Use this repo to debug the **JSON** request from **Exceptional**. By default, shows only the last data sent.
